parameters :
    input_one_sequence:
        ui-name : |
            Query Sequence
        short-hint : |
            Single DNA sequence to use for the search.  If you enter something here, Query Object will be ignored.
        placeholder : |
            Enter DNA sequence...
    input_one_name:
        ui-name : |
            Query Object
        short-hint : |
            Query with single DNA sequence to use as query.  Data types may be Feature, SingleEndLibrary (with one sequence), or FeatureSet (with one sequence).
        placeholder : |
            ...or select DNA Query Object
    input_many_name:
        ui-name : |

        ui-name : |
            Output Object
        short-hint : |
