parameters :
    input_one_sequence:
        ui-name : |
            Query Sequence
        short-hint : |
            Single DNA sequence to use for the search.  If you enter something here, Query Object will be created with this sequence as a SingleEndLibrary.
        placeholder : |
            Optionally enter DNA sequence...
    input_one_name:
        ui-name : |
            Query Object
        short-hint : |
            Query with single DNA sequence to use as query (created if sequence entered above).  Data types may be Feature, SingleEndLibrary (with one sequence), or FeatureSet (with one sequence).
        placeholder : |
            ...or select DNA Query Object
    input_many_name:
        ui-name : |
            Targets Object
        short-hint : |
            DNA Targets object to be searched.  Data types may be SingleEndLibrary, FeatureSet, Genome, or GenomeSet.
    output_filtered_name:
        ui-name : |
            Output Object
        short-hint : |
            Object containing matches.  Output will be SingleEndLibrary for SingleEndLibrary Targets, otherwise will be FeatureSet.
    ident_thresh:
        ui-name : |
            Identity Threshold
        short-hint : |
            threshold for hits
    e_value:
        ui-name : |
            E-value
        short-hint : |
            threshold for hits
    bitscore:
        ui-name : |
            Bit Score
        short-hint : |
            threshold for hits
    overlap_fraction:
        ui-name : |
            Overlap Fraction
        short-hint : |
            threshold for hits
    maxaccepts:
        ui-name : |
            Max Accepts
        short-hint : |
            limits the number of hits in result.  Default: 1000
